      "        '''Anarchism''' is an anti-authoritarian political and social philosophy that rejects hierarchy as unjust and advocates its replacement with self-managed, self-governed societies based on voluntary, cooperative institutions. These institutions are often described as stateless societies, although several authors have defined them more specifically as distinct institutions based on non-hierarchical or free associations. Anarchism's central disagreement with other ideologies is that it holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful.  Anarchism is usually placed on the far-left of the political spectrum, and much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism, or participatory economics. As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview, many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely. Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism, or similar dual classifications.  == Etymology, terminology, and definition ==   The etymological origin of the word anarchism is from the ancient Greek word ''anarkhia'',  meaning \"without a ruler\", composed of the prefix ''a-'' (i.e. \"without\") and the word ''arkhos'' (i.e. \"leader\" or \"ruler\"). The suffix -ism denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy. The word anarchism appears in English from 1642 as ''anarchisme''<ref></ref> and the word ''anarchy'' from 1539.<ref></ref> Various factions within the French Revolution labelled their opponents as anarchists, although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as William Godwin (1756–1836) and Wilhelm Weitling (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs.  The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist () was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France, the term libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. On the other hand, some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, referring to free-market anarchism as libertarian anarchism.  While opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought, defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is a lot of talk among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently. Hence, it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing authority and hierarchical organization (including the state,  capitalism,  nationalism and all associated institutions) in the conduct of all human relations in favour of a society based on voluntary association, on freedom and on decentralisation, but this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on etymology (which is simply a negation of a ruler), or based on anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that) or even the anti-authoritarian (which is an ''a posteriori'' conclusion). Nonetheless, major elements of the definition of anarchism include the following: # The will for a non-coercive society. # The rejection of the state apparatus. # The belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society. # A suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy.  == History ==   === Pre-modern era === [[Zeno of Citium (c. 334 – c. 262 BC), whose ''Republic'' inspired Peter Kropotkin]] During the prehistoric era of mankind, an established authority did not exist. It was after the creation of towns and cities that institutions of authority were established and anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction. Most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in China and Greece. In China, philosophical anarchism was delineated by Taoist philosophers Zhuangzi and Lao Tzu. Likewise in Greece, anarchic attitudes were articulated by tragedians and philosophers. Aeschylus and Sophocles used the myth of Antigone to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and personal autonomy. Socrates questioned Athenian authorities constantly and insisted to the right of individual freedom of consciousness. Cynics dismissed human law (''nomos'') and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (''physis''). Stoics were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.  During the Middle Ages, there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the Islamic world or in Christian Europe. This kind of tradition later gave birth to religious anarchism. In Persia, Mazdak called for an egalitarian society and the abolition of monarchy, only to be soon executed by the king. In Basra, religious sects preached against the state. In Europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies. Libertarian ideas further emerged during the Renaissance with the spread of reasoning and humanism through Europe. Novelists fictionalised ideal societies that were based not on coercion but voluntarism. The Enlightenment further pushed towards anarchism with the optimism for social progress.  === Modern era === During the French Revolution, the partisan groups of Enragés and  saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti-state and federalist sentiments. The first anarchist currents developed thoughout the 18th century—William Godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in England, morally delegitimizing the state, Max Stirner's thinking paved the way to individualism, and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's theory of mutualism found fertile soil in France. This era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the Spanish Civil War of 1936 and is considered the golden age of anarchism.   Anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin opposed the Marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat and allied himself with the federalists in the First International before his expulsion by the Marxists]] Drawing from mutualism, Mikhail Bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the International Workingmen's Association, a class worker union later known as the First International that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. The International became a significant political force, and Karl Marx a leading figure and a member of its General Council. Bakunin's faction, the Jura Federation and Proudhon's followers, the mutualists, opposed Marxist state socialism, advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings. After bitter disputes the Bakuninists were expelled from the International by the Marxists at the 1872 Hague Congress. Bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by Marxist's terms, they would end up the new tyrants of workers. After being expelled, anarchists formed the St. Imier International. Under the influence of Peter Kropotkin, a Russian philosopher and scientist, anarcho-communism overlapped with collectivism. Anarcho-communists, who drew inspiration from the 1871 Paris Commune, advocated for free federation and distribution of goods according to one's needs.  At the turning of the century, anarchism had spread all over the world. In China, small groups of students imported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism. Tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east, pouring into the Japanese capital to study. In Latin America, São Paulo was a stronghold for anarcho-syndicalism where it became the most prominent left-wing ideology. During this time, a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary political violence. This strategy became known as propaganda of the deed. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many Communards to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune favoured individualist political expression and acts. Even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts, infamy came upon the movement. Illegalism was another strategy which some anarchists adopted these same years.  [[Nestor Makhno with members of the anarchist Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] Anarchists enthusiastically participated in the Russian Revolution—despite concerns—in opposition to the Whites. However, they met harsh suppression after the Bolshevik government was stabilized. Several anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine, notably leading to the Kronstadt rebellion and Nestor Makhno's struggle in the Free Territory. With the anarchists being crushed in Russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely platformism and synthesis anarchism. The former sought to create a coherent group that would push for the revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. Seeing the victories of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War, many workers and activists turned to communist parties which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, members of major syndicalist movements, the General Confederation of Labour and Industrial Workers of the World, left their organisations and joined the Communist International.  In the Spanish Civil War, anarchists and syndicalists (CNT and FAI) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists. A long tradition of Spanish anarchism led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war. In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land. The Soviet Union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war, but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named May Days as Joseph Stalin tried to seize control of the Republicans.  === Post-war era === [[Rojava is supporting efforts for workers to form cooperatives, such as this sewing cooperative]] At the end of World War II, the anarchist movement was severely weakened. However, the 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism likely caused by a perceived failure of Marxism–Leninism and tensions built by the Cold War. During this time, anarchism took root in other movements critical to both the state and capitalism such as the anti-nuclear, environmental and pacifist movements, the New Left, and the counterculture of the 1960s. Anarchism became associated with punk subculture as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols, and the established feminist tendencies of anarcha-feminism returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism.  Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence within anti-war, anti-capitalist and anti-globalisation movements. Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the World Trade Organization, Group of Eight and World Economic Forum. During the protests, ''ad hoc'' leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs engaged in rioting, property destruction and violent confrontations with the police. Other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture, affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at the WTO conference in Seattle in 1999. Anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the Zapatistas in Mexico, and the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, more commonly known as Rojava, a ''de facto'' autonomous region in northern Syria.  == Schools of thought ==  Anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, social anarchism and individualist anarchism, owing to their different origins, values and evolution. The individualist current emphasises negative liberty, in opposing restraints upon the free individual, while the social current emphasises positive liberty, in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and social ownership. In a chronological sense, anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century, and the post-classical currents (such as anarchafeminism, green anarchism and postanarchism) developed thereafter.  Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy, without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism, philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a minimal state, but argues that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy.  One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives, a call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by Fernando Tarrida del Mármol in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time. Despite separation, the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities, but as tendencies that intermingle.  === Classical ===  [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was the primary proponent of anarcho-mutualism and influenced many future individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers]] Mutualism and individualism were inceptive among classical anarchist currents, followed by the major collectivist, communist and syndicalist currents of social anarchism. Social anarchist theory rejects private property, seeing it separate from personal property as a source of social inequality, and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid. Major currents within classical anarchism include:  * Mutualism is an 18th century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Its aims include reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to the American mutualist William Batchelder Greene, each worker in the mutualist system would receive \"just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount\". Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism. Proudhon first characterised his goal as a \"third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property\".  * Collectivist anarchism, also known as anarchist collectivism or anarcho-collectivism, is a revolutionary socialist form of anarchism commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin and Johann Most. Collectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production, theorised to be achieved through violent revolution, and that workers be paid according to time worked, rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism. This position was criticised by anarcho-communists as effectively \"uphold[ing] the wages system\". Collectivist anarchism arose alongside Marxism, but rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.  * Anarcho-communism, also known as anarchist-communism, communist anarchism and libertarian communism, is a theory of anarchism that advocates a communist society with common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy, and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need\". Anarcho-communism developed from radical socialist currents after the French Revolution, but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International. It was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin.  * Anarcho-syndicalism, also referred to as revolutionary syndicalism, is a branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are workers' solidarity, direct action and workers' self-management. Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action—that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action such as electing a representative to a government position—will allow workers to liberate themselves.  * Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions and ideological systems. Early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include William Godwin, Max Stirner and Henry David Thoreau. Through many countries, individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and intellectuals, free love and birth control advocates, individualist naturists and nudists, freethought and anti-clerical activists, as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation.  === Post-classical and contemporary ===  [[Lawrence Jarach (left) and John Zerzan (right), two prominent contemporary anarchist authors, with Zerzan being a prominent voice within anarcho-primitivism and Jarach a noted advocate of post-left anarchy]]  Anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left. Interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the anti-globalization movement, whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation. As the movement shaped 21st century radicalism, wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest. Contemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has reinforced anarchism's historical association with chaos and violence, though its publicity has also led more scholars to engage with the anarchist movement. Anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements—at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources, and syncretic, combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches. The anti-capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents.   Various anarchist groups, tendencies and schools of thought exist today, making it difficult to describe contemporary anarchist movement. While theorists and activists have established \"relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles\", there is no consensus on which principles are core. As a result, commentators describe multiple \"anarchisms\" (rather than a singular \"anarchism\") in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently. For example, gender equality can be a common principle but ranks as a higher priority to anarcha-feminists than anarchist communists. Anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in the following forms: \"all centralized and hierarchical forms of government (e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism, etc.), economic class systems (e.g., capitalism, Bolshevism, feudalism, slavery, etc.), autocratic religions (e.g., fundamentalist Islam, Roman Catholicism, etc.), patriarchy, heterosexism, white supremacy, and imperialism\". Anarchist schools, however, disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed.  == Tactics == Anarchists' tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals—first, to oppose the establishment; and second, to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society, illustrating the ''unity of means and ends''. A broad categorization can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by ''revolutionary'' means, and aims to change society through ''evolutionary'' means.  Evolutionary tactics reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims, though there is significant overlap between the two.  Anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century. Anarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and militancy, while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches.  ===Classical era tactics=== The relationship between [[anarchism and violence is a controversial subject among anarchists. Pictured is Leon Czolgosz assassinating U.S. President William McKinley.]] During the classical era, anarchists had a militant tendency. Not only did they confront state armed forces (as in Spain and Ukraine) but some also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed. Assasination attempts were made against heads of state, some being successful. Anarchists also took part in revolutions. Anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexing and controversial. On one hand, anarcho-pacifists point out the unity of means and ends. On the other hand, other anarchist groups are for direct action that can include sabotage or even terrorism. This attitude was quite prominent a century ago; seeing the state as a tyrant, some anarchists saw every right to oppose its oppression by any mean possible. Emma Goldman and Errico Malatesta, who were proponents of limited use of violence, argued that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a necessary evil.  Anarchists took an active role in strikes, though they tended to be antipathetic to formal syndicalism, seeing it as reformist. They saw it as a part of overthrowing state and capitalism. Anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts, some practicing nudism. They were also building communities based on friendship. They were also involved in the press.  ===Revolutionary tactics===  In the current era, Italian anarchist Alfredo Bonanno, a proponent of insurrectionary anarchism, has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by Kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards. Both Bonanno and the French group The Invisible Committee advocate for small, informal affiliation groups, where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state, capitalism and other enemies. Members of The Invisible Committee were arrested in 2008 on various charges, terrorism included.  Overall though, today's anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors. Mostly they engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots, especially in countries like Canada, Mexico or Greece. Μilitant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police. But Anarchists not only clash with state operators, they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists, taking antifa action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening.  ===Evolutionary tactics=== Anarchists commonly employ direct action, which can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchies, or the form of self-managing their lives through the creation of counterinstitutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives. Often decision-making is handled in an anti-authoritarian way, with everyone having equal say in each decision, an approach known as horizontalism. Contemporary-era anarchists have been engaging with various grass root movements that are not explicitly anarchist but are more or less based on horizontalism, respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations. The newly coined term \"small-a anarchism,\" in contrast with \"big-A anarchism\" of the classical era, signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical-era anarchism or to refer to Kropotkin or Proudhon to justify their opinions. They would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience, which they will later theorize.  The decision-making process of small affinity anarchist groups play a significant tactical role. Anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group, without the need of a leader or a leading group. One way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point. Minorities usually accept rough consensus, except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist goals, values or ethics. Anarchists usually form small groups (5–20 individuals) to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members. These kind of groups more often than not interconnect with each other, forming larger networks. Anarchists still support and participate in strikes, especially wildcat strikes- these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate.  Anarchists have gone online to spread their message. As in the past, newspapers and journals are used, but because of distributional and other difficulties, anarchists have found it easier to create websites, hosting electronic libraries and other portals. Anarchists were also involved in developing various softwares that are available for free. The way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals, especially when it comes to preserving user's privacy from state surveillance.  Anarchists organize themselves to squat and reclaim public spaces. During important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called Temporary Autonomous Zones (TAZ), spaces where surrealism, poetry and art are blended to display the anarchist ideal.  Squatting, as seen by anarchists is a way to regain urban space that capitalist market, serving pragmatical needs and is also seen an exemplary direct action. Acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds.   == Key issues ==  <!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. --> As anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought and disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common, its diversity has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory. For instance, the compatibility of capitalism, nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as Marxism, communism, collectivism and trade unionism. Anarchists may be motivated by humanism, divine authority, enlightened self-interest, veganism, or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as civilisation, technology (e.g. within anarcho-primitivism) and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.  === Gender, sexuality and free love ===   French individualist anarchist Émile Armand propounded the virtues of free love in the Parisian anarchist milieu of the early 20th century]]  Gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy; anarchism is obliged to address, analyse, and oppose the suppression of one's autonomy because of the dynamics that gender roles traditionally impose.  A historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was free love, and in an way it still survives as tendency supporting polyamory and queer anarchism. Free love advocates were against marriage which saw as a way of men imposing authority over women because of marriage laws giving the upper hand to males. The notion of free love though was much broader, it was a critique to the whole established order that limited women from sexual freedom and pleasure. This movement became close to reality as there have been various household that hosted many comrades sharing a common bed. Free love had roots both in Europe and the USA. Some anarchists soon found out that free love wasn't without adverse effects as jealously arose. Anarchist feminists were advocates of free love, against marriage, pro-choice (utilizing a contemporary term) and had a likewise agenda.  Anarchist and non anarchist feminists differed on suffrage, but still they were supportive of each other. .  During the second half of the 20th century, anarchism intermingled with the second wave of anarchism, radicalizing some currents of the feminist movement-and got influenced as well. By the latest decades of the 20th century, anarchist and feminists  were advocating for rights and autonomy of women, gays, queers and other marginalized groups  with some feminist thinkers suggesting the fusion of the two currents.  With the third wave of anarchism sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality were put under the anarchist’s microscope and yielded a post-structuralist critique of sexual normality.  Though, few anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking, suggesting it is leaning towards individualism and therefore dropping the cause of social liberation.  === Anarchism and education ===   {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border: none; background: none; float: right;\" |+ Anarchist vs Statist perspectives on education<br><small> by Ruth Kinna (2019)</small> |- ! scope=\"col\" |  ! scope=\"col\" | Anarchist education ! scope=\"col\" | State education |- | Concept|| Education as self-mastery || education as service |- | Management || community based || state run |- | Methods||Practice-based learning||Vocational training |- |Aims||Being a critical member of society||Being a productive member of society |}  Anarchist's interest to Education stretches back to the first steps of classical anarchism. Anarchists see proper education that sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and society, as an act of mutual aid. Anarchists writers such as Willian Godwin and Max Stirner attacked both state orchestrated public education and elitist education as they saw it as another way for the ruling class to replicate their privileges.  In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker Francisco Ferrer established the modern in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church. Ferrer's approach was secular, rejecting both the state and church involvement in the educational process and gave pupils plenty of autonomy (i.e. on setting the curriculum). Ferrer was aiming to educate the working class. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later on arrested. Ferrer's ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of modern schools around the world. Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy had also established a school, it 's major principle was ''\"for education to be effective it had to be free\"'', as Tolstoy himself explained. In a similar token, A.S. Neill founding what became Summerhill School in 1921- also declaring being free from coercion.. All anarchist schools were based mostly on a moral value- respecting childrens right to develop freely without manipulations. But they faced a dilemma, should they guide youngsters towards political and class struggles? Most anarchist educators of early 20th century didn't take a neutral stance· the specific question kept troubling anarchist the decades to come Some decades later, anarchist authors such Colin Ward, Hearbert Read and Paul Goodman intensified and expanded anarchist's critique to State education, even the need for schooling as a pedagogical method, suggesting a system that would focus on children's creativity rather than turning them into career-hunters.   While not many anarchists schools survived to the current era, major tenets of anarchists schools, such as respect for child autonomy and freedom, relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination, have spread in mainstream educational institutions portraying themselves as democratic.  === Anarchism and the state === <!-- Important! Strive to explain how anarchists perceive authority and oppression and why they reject them. Jun (2019), p. 41. --> Objection to the state and its institutions is ''sine qua non'' of anarchism. Anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and it is illegitimate regardless of political tendencies. Instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. Authority ultimately rests solely on power regardless if it is open or transparent as it still has the ability to coerce people. Another anarchist argument against states is that some people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. Anarchists consider the argument that the state is the collective will of people as a fairy tale since the ruling class is distinct from the rest of the society.  == Criticism == Moral and pragmatic criticism of anarchism includes allegations of utopianism, tacit authoritarianism and vandalism towards feats of civilisation.  === Allegation of utopianism === Anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics, often in general and formal debate. European history professor Carl Landauer argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a \"lesser evil\" than a society without \"repressive force\". He also argued that \"ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears\" is an \"absurdity\". However, ''An Anarchist FAQ'' states the following: \"Anarchy is not a utopia, [and] anarchists make no such claims about human perfection. [...] Remaining disputes would be solved by reasonable methods, for example, the use of juries, mutual third parties, or community and workplace assemblies\". It also states that \"some sort of 'court' system would still be necessary to deal with the remaining crimes and to adjudicate disputes between citizens\".  === Industrial civilisation === In his essay ''On Authority'', Friedrich Engels claimed that radical decentralisation promoted by anarchists would destroy modern industrial civilisation, citing an example of railways and making the following point:   In the end, it is argued that authority in any form is a natural occurrence which should not be abolished.  === Tacit authoritarianism === The anarchist tendency known as platformism has been criticised by Situationists, insurrectionaries, synthesis anarchists and others of preserving tacitly statist, authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies.<ref></ref>  == List of anarchist societies ==   * Federation of Neighborhood Councils-El Alto (Fejuve; 1979–present) * Popular Indigenous Council of Oaxaca \"Ricardo Flores Magón\" (CIPO-RFM; 1980s–present) * Barbacha (2001–present)<ref></ref> * Villa de Zaachila (2006–present)<ref></ref> * Cheran (2011–present)<ref></ref> * Democratic Federation of Northern Syria (Rojava; 2013–present)<ref></ref><ref> anarchistnews.org|website=anarchistnews.org|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref>  \n",

Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.<ref name=Filipek /> Individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.<ref name=London />  ===Social development=== Social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders (ASD; see Classification) from other developmental disorders.<ref name=Rapin /> People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic Temple Grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals, or people with typical neural development, as leaving her feeling \"like an anthropologist on Mars\".<ref></ref>  Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood.<!-- ref name=Volkmar/ --> Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things.<ref name=Volkmar /> Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers.<ref></ref> Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less pronounced autistic traits.<ref></ref> Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition<ref name=\"Sigman\"></ref> although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.<ref></ref>  Children with high-functioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.<ref name=Burgess />   There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and meltdowns.<ref></ref>  ===Communication=== About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.<ref></ref> Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words (echolalia)<ref name=Landa /><ref name=Tager-Flusberg /> or reverse pronouns.<ref name=Kanner1943 /> Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD.<ref name=John2007 /> For example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object,<ref name=Volkmar /><ref name=Tager-Flusberg /> and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience.<ref name=John2007 /> Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.<ref name=\"Landa\"></ref><ref name=\"Tager-Flusberg\"></ref>  In a pair of studies, high-functioning children with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and as adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.<ref name=\"Williams\"></ref>  ===Repetitive behavior=== A young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row Autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.<ref name=Lam-Aman />  * Stereotyped behaviors: Repetitive movements, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking. * Compulsive behaviors: Time-consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules, such as placing objects in a specific order, checking things, or hand washing. * Sameness: Resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted. * Ritualistic behavior: Unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.<ref name=\"Lam-Aman\"></ref> * Restricted interests: Interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game. * Self-injury: Behaviors such as eye-poking, skin-picking, hand-biting and head-banging.<ref name=John2007 />  No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.<ref></ref>  ===Other symptoms=== Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.<ref name=\"Filipek\"> This paper represents a consensus of representatives from nine professional and four parent organizations in the US.</ref> An estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants.<ref></ref> Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population.<ref></ref> Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some,<ref name=\"Geschwind-2009\"></ref> although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders.<ref></ref> Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements).<ref></ref> An estimated 60–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking;<ref name=Geschwind-2009 /> deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.<ref></ref> Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur.<ref name=\"Dominick\"></ref>  There is tentative evidence that autism occurs more frequently in people with gender dysphoria.<ref></ref><ref></ref>  Gastrointestinal problems are one of the most commonly associated medical disorders in people with autism.<ref name=\"IsraelyanMargolis2018\"/> These are linked to greater social impairment, irritability, behavior and sleep problems, language impairments and mood changes.<ref name=\"IsraelyanMargolis2018\"></ref><ref name=\"WasilewskaKlukowski2015\"></ref>  Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of stress.<ref name=\"Volkmar\"> |isbn=978-1-118-28220-5 |oclc=946133861 |lccn=2013034363 |page=301 |access-date=1 March 2019 }}</ref> Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with Down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship. However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.<ref></ref>  ==Causes==   It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's characteristic triad of symptoms.<ref name=\"Fractionable\" /> However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.<ref name=\"Fractionable\"></ref><ref name=\"HappeTime\"></ref>  Deletion (1), duplication (2) and inversion (3) are all [[chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism.<ref name=\"Beaudet\" />]] Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants.<ref name=\"Abrahams\"></ref><ref></ref> Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression.<ref name=\"Rapin\"></ref> Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.<ref name=\"SandersHe2015\"></ref> Studies of twins suggest that heritability is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for ASD, and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population.<ref name=\"Geschwind-2009\" /> However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified. Typically, autism cannot be traced to a Mendelian (single-gene) mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality, and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD.<ref name=\"Abrahams\" /> Numerous candidate genes have been located, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene.<ref name=Abrahams /> Most loci individually explain less than 1% of cases of autism.<ref></ref> The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation&nbsp;— such as deletions, duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome.<ref name=\"Beaudet\"></ref> Autism may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition,<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/14/thousands-of-autistic-girls-and-women-going-undiagnosed-due-to-gender-bias Thousands of autistic girls and women 'going undiagnosed' due to gender bias] ''The Guardian''</ref> but genetic phenomena such as imprinting and X linkage have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in males, and theories have been put forward for a genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often, such as the imprinted brain theory and the extreme male brain theory.<ref name=\":02\"></ref><ref name=\":2\"></ref><ref></ref>  Maternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal neurodevelopment.

Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors.<ref name=\"Penn\"></ref> The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.<ref name=London />  There is evidence that gut–brain axis abnormalities may be involved.<ref name=\"WasilewskaKlukowski2015\" /><ref name=RaoGershon2016 /><ref name=IsraelyanMargolis2018 /> A 2015 review proposed that immune dysregulation, gastrointestinal inflammation, malfunction of the autonomic nervous system, gut flora alterations, and food metabolites may cause brain neuroinflammation and dysfunction.<ref name=\"WasilewskaKlukowski2015\" /><!-- Quote = immune dysregulation, GI inflammation, malfunction of the ANS, genetic and metabolic activity of the microbiome, and dietary metabolites may contribute to brain dysfunction and neuroinflammation depending upon individual genetic vulnerability --> A 2016 review concludes that enteric nervous system abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism.

These deficits are present in early childhood, typically before age three, and lead to clinically significant functional impairment.<ref name=DSM5 /> Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language, and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by Rett syndrome, intellectual disability or global developmental delay.<ref name=DSM5 /> ICD-10 uses essentially the same definition.<ref name=\"ICD-10-F84.0\"></ref>  Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)<ref></ref> uses observation and interaction with the child. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.<ref name=Volkmar /> The Diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders (DISCO) may also be used.<ref></ref>  A pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated medical conditions.<ref name=Dover /> A pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions.<ref name=\"Kanne\"></ref> A differential diagnosis for ASD at this stage might also consider intellectual disability, hearing impairment, and a specific language impairment<ref name=Dover /> such as Landau–Kleffner syndrome.<ref></ref> The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression.<ref></ref>  Clinical genetics evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause.<ref name=Caronna /> Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes,<ref></ref> consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and fragile X testing.<ref name=Caronna /> A genotype-first model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations.<ref></ref> As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism's genetics.<ref></ref> Metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine.<ref name=Caronna />  ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.<ref name=Land2008 /> In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.<ref name=\"Dover\"></ref> Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits. Girls are often diagnosed later than boys.<ref></ref>  Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.<ref></ref> It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired, partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms.<ref></ref>  ===Classification=== Autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.<ref name=ICD-10-F84.0 /> These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.<ref name=Rapin />  Of the five PDD forms, Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; PDD not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS; also called ''atypical autism'') is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.<ref></ref> Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development.<ref name=\"DSM-IV-TR-299.00\"></ref> The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the ''autism spectrum disorders'' (ASD)<ref name=CCD2007 /> or sometimes the ''autistic disorders'',<ref></ref> whereas autism itself is often called ''autistic disorder'', ''childhood autism'', or ''infantile autism''. In this article, ''autism'' refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, ''autism'', ''ASD'', and ''PDD'' are often used interchangeably.<ref name=\"Caronna\"></ref> ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as avoiding eye contact.<ref></ref>  Autism can also be divided into syndromal and non-syndromal autism; the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms, such as tuberous sclerosis.<ref></ref> Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism, the extent of the overlap between Asperger syndrome, HFA, and non-syndromal autism is unclear.<ref>Validity of ASD subtypes:  * *</ref>  Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress, typically from 15 to 30 months of age. The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype,<ref name=Stef2008 /><ref name=Landa /><ref name=Land2008 /><ref> A partial update is in: </ref> or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression.<ref></ref>  Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population<ref></ref> and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry, psychology, neurology and pediatrics.<ref></ref> Newer technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes (observable traits) that can be viewed on brain scans, to help further neurogenetic studies of autism;<ref></ref> one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects.<ref name=Lev2009 /> It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior.<ref></ref>  ==== Spectrum ==== Autism has long been thought to cover a wide spectrum, ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, developmentally disabled, and prone to frequent repetitive behavior such as hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, pedantic communication.<ref></ref> Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary.<ref name=Geschwind-2009 /> Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or high-functioning autism (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on IQ thresholds.<ref></ref> Some people have called for an end to the terms \"high-functioning\" and \"low-functioning\" due to lack of nuance and the potential for a person's needs or abilities to be overlooked.<ref></ref><ref></ref>  ==Screening== About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months.<ref name=Land2008 /> According to an article, failure to meet any of the following milestones \"is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations. Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome\".<ref name=Filipek /> * No response to name (or eye-to-eye gaze) by 6 months.<ref name=CDCearlywarningsigns></ref>  * No babbling by 12 months. * No gesturing (pointing, waving, etc.) by 12 months. * No single words by 16 months. * No two-word (spontaneous, not just echolalic) phrases by 24 months. * Loss of any language or social skills, at any age.  The United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns.<ref></ref> The Japanese practice is to screen all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests. In contrast, in the UK, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened.

All of them compared gluten- and casein-free diet versus normal diet with a control group (2 double blind randomized controlled trials, 1 double blind crossover trial, 1 single blind trial). In two of the studies, whose duration was 12 and 24 months, a significant improvement in ASD symptoms (efficacy rate 50%) was identified.

About half of people in their 20s with autism are not employed.<ref></ref>  ==Epidemiology==  Reports of autism cases per 1,000 children grew dramatically in the US from 1996 to 2007. It is unknown how much, if any, growth came from changes in rates of autism.  Most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD as of 2007.<ref name=News2007 /> A 2016 survey in the United States reported a rate of 25 per 1,000 children for ASD.<ref></ref> Globally, autism affects an estimated 24.8 million people , while Asperger syndrome affects a further 37.2 million.<ref name=GBD2015Pre /> In 2012, the NHS estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the UK was 1.1%.<ref name=NHSEstimating></ref> Rates of PDD-NOS's has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000, and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0.02 per 1,000.<ref name=\"Fombonne-2009\"></ref> CDC estimates about 1 out of 59 (1.7%) for 2014, an increase from 1 out of every 68 children (1.5%) for 2010.<ref> CDC |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=7 March 2019 |date=15 November 2018}}</ref>  The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s.

The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with intellectual disability and more than 5.5:1 without.<ref name=\"News2007\" /> Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated, but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed;<ref name=\"Chaste\"></ref> one theory is that females are underdiagnosed.<ref></ref>  Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy.<ref name=Chaste /><ref></ref> The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism.<ref name=\"Geschwind\"></ref> Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.<ref></ref>  Several other conditions are common in children with autism.<ref name=Lev2009 /> They include: * '''Genetic disorders'''. About 10–15% of autism cases have an identifiable Mendelian (single-gene) condition, chromosome abnormality, or other genetic syndrome,<ref></ref> and ASD is associated with several genetic disorders.<ref></ref> * '''Intellectual disability'''. The percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing intelligence of individuals on the autism spectrum.<ref></ref> In comparison, for PDD-NOS the association with intellectual disability is much weaker,<ref></ref> and by definition, the diagnosis of Asperger's excludes intellectual disability.<ref></ref> * '''Anxiety disorders''' are common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%. Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself, or are hard to distinguish from ASD's symptoms.<ref></ref> * '''Epilepsy''', with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age, cognitive level, and type of language disorder.<ref></ref> * Several '''metabolic defects''', such as phenylketonuria, are associated with autistic symptoms.<ref name=\"Manzi\"></ref> * '''Minor physical anomalies''' are significantly increased in the autistic population.<ref></ref> * '''Preempted diagnoses'''. Although the DSM-IV rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome, and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted.<ref></ref> * '''Sleep problems''' affect about two-thirds of individuals with ASD at some point in childhood. These most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and early morning awakenings. Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress, and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis.<ref></ref>  ==History==  Portrait of [[Victor of Aveyron, a feral child caught in 1798 who displayed possible symptoms of autism<ref name=\"Wolff\"/>]]  A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The ''Table Talk'' of Martin Luther, compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic.<ref></ref> Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report.<ref></ref> The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance.<ref></ref> The Wild Boy of Aveyron, a feral child caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student Jean Itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.<ref name=\"Wolff\"></ref>  The New Latin word ''autismus'' (English translation ''autism'') was coined by the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia. He derived it from the Greek word ''autós'' (αὐτός, meaning \"self\"), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to \"autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance\".<ref> The quote is a translation of Bleuler's 1910 original.</ref> A Soviet child psychiatrist, Grunya Sukhareva, described a similar syndrome that was published in Russian in 1925, and in German in 1926.<ref></ref>  === Clinical development and diagnoses === [[Leo Kanner introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in 1943.]]  The word ''autism'' first took its modern sense in 1938 when Hans Asperger of the Vienna University Hospital adopted Bleuler's terminology ''autistic psychopaths'' in a lecture in German about child psychology.<ref></ref> Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as Asperger syndrome, though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.<ref name=\"Wolff\" /> Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital first used ''autism'' in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.<ref name=\"Kanner1943\"> Reprinted in </ref> Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably \"autistic aloneness\" and \"insistence on sameness\", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.<ref name=\"HappeTime\" /> It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.<ref name=\"Lyons\"></ref>  Donald Triplett was the first person diagnosed with autism.<ref name=\"Britannica\" /> He was diagnosed by Kanner after being first examined in 1938, and was labeled as \"case 1\".<ref name=\"Britannica\"></ref> Triplett was noted for his savant abilities, particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and to mentally multiply numbers. His father, Oliver, described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns, music notes, letters of the alphabet, and U.S. president pictures. By the age of 2, he had the ability to recite the 23rd Psalm and memorized 25 questions and answers from the Presbyterian catechism. He was also interested in creating musical chords.<ref name=\"Atlantic\"></ref>  Kanner's reuse of ''autism'' led to decades of confused terminology like ''infantile schizophrenia'', and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to \"refrigerator mothers\". Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome.<ref></ref>  === Terminology and distinction from schizophrenia === As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions.<ref></ref> Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have affected how ASD is viewed,<ref name=\"Wolff\" /> parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child's autistic behavior is perceived negatively,<ref></ref> and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.<ref></ref>  It took until 1980 for the DSM-III to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia. In 1987, the DSM-III-R provided a checklist for diagnosing autism. In May 2013, the DSM-5 was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including PDD-NOS, autism, Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, and CDD, has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders. The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction, and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors.<ref></ref>  The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely.<ref></ref> Societal and cultural aspects of autism have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being.<ref name=Sil2008 /><ref name=Frith2014 /><ref></ref>  ==Society and culture==  Autism awareness ribbon An autistic culture has emerged, accompanied by the autistic rights and neurodiversity movements.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref name=\"Solomon\"></ref> Events include World Autism Awareness Day, Autism Sunday, Autistic Pride Day, Autreat, and others.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Organizations dedicated to promoting awareness of autism include Autism Speaks, Autism National Committee, and Autism Society of America.<ref></ref> Social-science scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about \"autism as a culture, transcultural comparisons... and research on social movements.\"<ref></ref> While most autistic individuals do not have savant skills, many have been successful in their fields.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>  === Autism rights movement === The autism rights movement is a social movement within the context of disability rights that emphasizes the concept of neurodiversity, viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the human brain rather than a disorder to be cured.<ref name=\"Solomon\" /> The autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors; therapies that focus on coping skills rather than on imitating the behaviors of those without autism;<ref name=Bigthink></ref> and the recognition of the autistic community as a minority group.<ref name=Bigthink /><ref name= Jaarsma2012></ref> Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome. This perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views: the medical perspective, that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene(s), and fringe theories that autism is caused by environmental factors such as vaccines.<ref name=\"Solomon\" /> A common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are \"high-functioning\" or have Asperger syndrome and do not represent the views of \"low-functioning\" autistic people.<ref name= Jaarsma2012 />  ===Employment=== About half of autistics are unemployed, and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed.<ref name=\"Ohl\"></ref> Among autistics who find work, most are employed in sheltered settings working for wages below the national minimum.<ref></ref> While employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision, experienced employers of autistics give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as a high regard for rules and procedure in autistic employees.<ref name=\"Ohl\"/> A majority of the economic burden of autism is caused by decreased earnings in the job market.<ref></ref> Some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care for autistic children.<ref></ref><ref></ref>  \n",

      "  diffusely reflected sunlight relative to various surface conditions]]  '''Albedo''' () (, meaning 'whiteness') is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation received by an astronomical body (e.g., a planet like Earth). It is dimensionless and measured on a scale from 0, corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation, to 1, corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation.  Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity to the irradiance (flux per unit area) received by a surface.<ref> The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface.<ref></ref> These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location and time (see position of the Sun). While bi-hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the Sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages.  Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation.<ref></ref> Due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (between 0.3 and 3 μm). This spectrum includes visible light (0.4–0.7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).  Albedo is an important concept in climatology, astronomy, and environmental management (e.g., as part of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program for sustainable rating of buildings). The average albedo of the Earth from the upper atmosphere, its ''planetary albedo'', is 30–35% because of cloud cover, but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.<ref></ref>  The term albedo was introduced into optics by Johann Heinrich Lambert in his 1760 work ''Photometria''.  ==Terrestrial albedo== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px\" |+ Sample albedos |- !

Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.<ref name=\"PhysicsWorld\"></ref> The average albedo of Earth is about 0.3.<ref name=\"Goode\"/> This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.  2003–2004 mean annual clear-sky and total-sky albedo Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASA's MODIS instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites, and the CERES instrument on the Suomi NPP and JPSS. As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional-hemispherical reflectance and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,<ref name=\"NASA\"/>). These calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. BDRF can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo.  Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about 15&nbsp;°C. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40&nbsp;°C.<ref name=\"washington\" /> If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0&nbsp;°C.<ref name=\"clim-past\"/> In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water – a so-called ocean planet – the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27&nbsp;°C.<ref name=\"Smith Robin\"/>  ===White-sky, black-sky, and blue-sky albedo=== For land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle ''θ''<sub>''i''</sub> can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: * the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, <math>{\\bar \\alpha(\\theta_i)}</math>, sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo, and * the bi-hemispherical reflectance, <math>\\bar{ \\bar \\alpha}</math>, sometimes referred to as white-sky albedo. with <math>{1-D}</math> being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and <math>{D}</math> being the proportion of diffuse illumination, the actual albedo <math>{\\alpha}</math> (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:  :<math>{\\alpha}= (1-D) \\bar \\alpha(\\theta_i) + D \\bar{ \\bar \\alpha}.</math>  This formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.<ref name=\"BlueskyAlbedo\"/>  == Astronomical albedo ==  The albedos of planets, satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (\"phase angle\"), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer Solar System objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids.  Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with an albedo of 0.99. Another notable high-albedo body is Eris, with an albedo of 0.96.<ref name=\"sicardy\">  </ref> Many small objects in the outer Solar System<ref name=\"tnoalbedo\"></ref> and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about 0.05.<ref name=\"astalbedo\"></ref> A typical comet nucleus has an albedo of 0.04.<ref name=\"dark\"></ref> Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds.  The overall albedo of the Moon is measured to be around 0.14,<ref name=\"CERESmoon\">  </ref> but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong opposition effect.<ref name=\"medkeff\" /> Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless Solar System bodies.  Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) geometric albedo (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the Bond albedo (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.  {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Planet ! Geometric !

The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, absolute magnitude and diameter is:<ref name=\"bruton\"></ref> <math>A =\\left ( \\frac{1329\\times10^{-H/5}}{D} \\right ) ^2</math>,  where <math>A</math> is the astronomical albedo, <math>D</math> is the diameter in kilometers, and <math>H</math> is the absolute magnitude. absorbing lots of light energy black would be better  ==Examples of terrestrial albedo effects==  ===Illumination=== Albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light, except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the Earth's surface at that location (e.g. through melting of reflective ice). That said, albedo and illumination both vary by latitude. Albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics, with a local maximum in the tropics.<ref name=Winston></ref>  ===Insolation effects=== The intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation, whereas areas such as the Sahara Desert, which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation.  Tropical and sub-tropical rainforest areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.  Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the Earth. This has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect.<ref></ref>  ===Climate and weather=== Albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs.<ref></ref> The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive weather.  ===Albedo–temperature feedback=== When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature feedback results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm air mass), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher insolation) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.  ===Snow=== Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow.<ref>Hall, D.K. and Martinec, J. (1985), ''Remote sensing of ice and snow''. Chapman and Hall, New York, 189 pp.</ref> Over Antarctica snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo positive feedback).  Just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water. Sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow. When sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases. The extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. As with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback.<ref>\"All About Sea Ice.\" National Snow and Ice Data Center. Accessed 16 November 2017. /cryosphere/seaice/index.html.</ref> Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for global warming.  Cryoconite, powdery windblown dust containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.<ref name = \"Nat. Geo\">[ \"Changing Greenland – Melt Zone\"] page 3, of 4, article by Mark Jenkins in ''National Geographic'' June 2010, accessed 8 July 2010</ref>  The dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback, together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo, can lead to large errors in energy estimates. Because of this, in order to reduce the error of energy estimates, it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions.  ===Small-scale effects=== Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.<ref name=\"ranknfile-ue\"></ref>  === Solar photovoltaic effects === Albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices. For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10%.<ref></ref> More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.<ref></ref>  ===Trees=== Because forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation). In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.<ref></ref> Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration. The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds.<ref></ref> Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate.<ref></ref>  In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. Deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.<ref name=\"mmutrees\" /> Variation in summer albedo across both forest types is correlated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy.<ref name=\"Ollinger\"></ref> The result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy.  Studies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.<ref name=\"Betts\" />  ===Water=== Reflectivity of smooth water at 20&nbsp;°C (refractive index=1.333) Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the Fresnel equations (see graph).  At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner (not diffusely). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small angles of incident light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.<ref name=\"Fresnel\" />  Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the terminator (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.  Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection. Snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9.  ===Clouds=== Cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. \"On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.\"<ref name=\"livescience\"></ref>  Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic.<ref></ref> A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10&nbsp;°C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.<ref name=\"harvard\"></ref>  ===Aerosol effects=== Aerosols (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain.<ref name=\"girda\"></ref> As per Spracklen et al.<ref name=\"DOMINICK\" /> the effects are: <blockquote> <!-- Aerosol radiative forcing. --> * ''Aerosol direct effect.'' Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming. * ''Aerosol indirect effect.'' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei. Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (''first indirect effect''), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (''second indirect effect''). </blockquote>  ===Black carbon=== Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m<sup>−2</sup>, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m<sup>−2</sup>.<ref name=\"girda 1\"></ref> Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.<ref>James Hansen & Larissa Nazarenko, ''Soot Climate Forcing Via Snow and Ice Albedos'', 101 Proc. of the Nat'l. Acad. of Sci. 423 (13 January 2004) (\"The efficacy of this forcing is »2 (i.e., for a given forcing it is twice as effective as CO<sub>2</sub> in altering global surface air temperature)\"); ''compare'' Zender Testimony, ''supra'' note 7, at 4 (figure 3); See J. Hansen & L. Nazarenko, ''supra'' note 18, at 426. (\"The efficacy for changes of Arctic sea ice albedo is >3. In additional runs not shown here, we found that the efficacy of albedo changes in Antarctica is also >3.\"); ''See also'' Flanner, M.G., C.S. Zender, J.T. Randerson, and P.J. Rasch, ''Present-day climate forcing and response from black carbon in snow'', 112 J. GEOPHYS. RES. D11202 (2007) (\"The forcing is maximum coincidentally with snowmelt onset, triggering strong snow-albedo feedback in local springtime. Consequently, the \"efficacy\" of black carbon/snow forcing is more than three times greater than forcing by CO<sub>2</sub>.\").</ref>  ===Human activities=== Human activities (e.g., deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult, further study is required to determine anthropogenic effects.<ref></ref>  ==Other types of albedo== Single-scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material (refractive index); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.  \n",
